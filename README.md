# Logistic-regression-For-Classification-
Trying to predict whether the person will buy or not buy the car base on the person’s’ Age and Income. The aim of this Logistic regression is estimates the probability of will the person buy or not buying the car based on a given dataset of the independent variables (Age and Income).
How is it working? 
The model measures the relationship between the dependent variable (going to Buy or Not Buying, that we want to predict) and the two independent variables (our features which are Age and Income), by estimating probabilities using it's underlying logistic function. These probabilities  then be transformed into binary values (0 or 1) in order to  make the prediction. Which is the job of the logistic function (sigmoid function). The values between 0 and 1 will then be changed into either 0 or 1 using a threshold classifier.
